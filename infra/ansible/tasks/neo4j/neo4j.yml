# TODO: Develop a robust method to install and run Neo4j, focusing on:
# - Maintainability: The setup should be easily adaptable, allowing for updates like changing the MongoDB version or adding users.
# - Readability: Use modularity to improve clarity and minimize code duplication, utilizing external files and variables where possible.
# - Persistence: Ensure data retention despite configuration updates (e.g., version changes).
# - Backup (Optional but recommended): Incorporate easy backup solutions, such as leveraging GCP External disks with Terraform and scripting backups in Ansible.
# Note: The current setup lacks data persistence, meaning data is lost when the MongoDB instance is updated.
